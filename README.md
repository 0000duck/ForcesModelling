# Requirements
The simulation is performed in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulink Simscape Multibody Add-On libraries are required and ATLAB version 2017a or newer.

# Usage
Make the main folder as a working folder and run 'SimInitializationGP.m' for the simulation initialization. Afterwards, run 'SimForcesGP2020a.slx' or 'SimForces2017a.slx'.

# Licence
See LICENCE.txt for licencing information.
